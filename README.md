# Why don't we use a Xcode template?

Apple didn't provide that much documentation about creating Xcode templates and it is the main reason why we don't use it.

There is an very interesting [blog post about it written by Danny Bravo](http://epic-apps.uk/2015/04/19/ready-set-xcode/), I encourage you to read it.
